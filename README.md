# School Enrollment Decision â€“ Agent-Based Model (NetLogo)

This project implements a simplified **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** in NetLogo to simulate household decisions regarding school enrollment in Pakistan.  
The model was developed as part of the **Equity Equation Project** to explore how socioeconomic and demographic factors affect the likelihood of children attending school.

## Project Context
In Pakistan, over 26 million children are out of school.  
This simulation models 200 households as agents, each with randomly assigned attributes such as:
- Food insecurity
- Transport availability
- Parents' education level
- Neighborhood safety
- Daughterâ€™s ability to work
- Distance to school

These attributes influence the householdâ€™s decision to enroll a child in school using a simple **scoring and penalty system**.

## âš™ Model Details

### Agent Attributes
Each household (`turtle`) has:
- `has-food-insecurity?` (boolean)
- `no-transport?` (boolean)
- `parents-uneducated?` (boolean)
- `unsafe-neighborhood?` (boolean)
- `has-daughter-can-work?` (boolean)
- `distance-over-5km?` (boolean)
- `is-enrolled?` (boolean â€“ outcome variable)

### Decision-Making Logic
1. Start with **score = 1.0**
2. Apply penalties:
   - Food insecurity â†’ -0.3
   - No transport â†’ -0.2
   - Parents uneducated â†’ -0.2
   - Unsafe neighborhood â†’ -0.2
   - Daughter can work â†’ -0.2
   - Distance over 5km â†’ -0.2
3. If **score > 0.5** â†’ enrolled (`is-enrolled? = true`, color = green)  
   Else â†’ not enrolled (`is-enrolled? = false`, color = red)

### Visualization
- **Green** = enrolled
- **Red** = not enrolled
- Agents positioned randomly in the NetLogo world

## ðŸ“Š Outputs
The model reports:
- Overall enrollment rate (%)
- Enrollment rate by **Food Insecurity** (Yes/No)
- Enrollment rate by **Daughter Can Work** (Yes/No)

Example results from one run:
| Metric                        | Percentage (%) |
|--------------------------------|---------------:|
| Overall Enrollment Rate        | 30             |
| Food Insecurity (Yes)          | 4.30           |
| Food Insecurity (No)           | 52.33          |
| Daughter Can Work (Yes)        | 18.68          |
| Daughter Can Work (No)         | 39.44          |
*(Values vary each run due to random household attributes.)*

## ðŸš€ How to Run
